Gobelin
======

Gobelin is a lightweight Node.JS HMVC framework which intends to simplify the
creation of modules via its HMVC architecture. It is also created to add
simplicity to Node.JS development as it has quite a steep learning curve. This
framework aims for both performances and ease-of-use while keeping it simple in
its source code.
